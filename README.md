# Github Testing ground 

Feel free to add files and fiddle around with Github a little bit. 

This Repo functions as a testing ground to get used to github functionalities. It will be deleted after a few weeks and replaced by the actual 'documentation' repo. 

Don't forget to keep the files up to date by regularly fetch - pull and push the data :).
